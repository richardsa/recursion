#Project: Recursion

Recursion project completed for <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/recursion?ref=lc-pb">The Odin Project</a>.

#Warmup: Fibonacci
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci Sequence</a>, which sums each number with the one before it, is a great example of a problem that can be solved recursively.</p>

<h3>Your Task</h3>

<ol>
<li>Write a method <code>#fibs</code> which takes a number and returns that many members of the fibonacci sequence.  Use iteration for this solution.</li>
<li>Now write another method <code>#fibs_rec</code> which solves the same problem recursively.  This can be done in just 3 lines (or 1 if you&#39;re crazy, but don&#39;t consider either of these lengths a requirement... just get it done).</li>
</ol>

#Project: Merge Sort
<ol>
<li>Build a method <code>#merge_sort</code> that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.</li>
<li><p>Tips:</p>

<ol>
<li>Think about what the base case is and what behavior is happening again and again and can actually be delegated to someone else (e.g. that same method!).</li>
<li>It may be helpful to check out the background videos again if you don&#39;t quite understand what should be going on.</li>
